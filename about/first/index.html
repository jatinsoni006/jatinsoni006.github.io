<h1 id=about-first>About FIRST</h1><blockquote><p>FIRST is an opportunity to come together as a group and share little pieces of our imagination to achieve something great.</p><p>—Rijuta Ravichandran, Class of 2008</p></blockquote><h2 id=what-is-first>What is <i class=first>FIRST</i>?</h2><p>Founded in 1989, <i class=first>FIRST</i> (For Inspiration and Recognition in Science and Technology) prides itself on its leadership in the scientific arena and its commitment to building a strong foundation for the country’s future workforce. Founder Dean Kamen, the recipient of the 2000 National Medal of Technology, has “awakened the innovative and imaginative leadership in America’s youth to the excitement of science and technology.” <i class=first>FIRST</i> has competitions for several different age groups, from JFLL (Junior <i class=first>FIRST</i> LEGO League) for elementary school students, FLL (<i class=first>FIRST</i> LEGO League) for middle school students, to FRC (<i class=first>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition) and FTC (<i class=first>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge) for high school students.</p><h2 id=first-robotics-competition-frc><i class=first>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition (FRC)</h2><p>One of <i class=first>FIRST</i>’s main goals is promoting scientific innovation through the annual <i class=first>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition (FRC), designed to immerse high school students in real-life engineering in the spirit of “Gracious Professionalism” to others. <i class=first>FIRST</i> has experienced exponential growth since its creation, and amazing success, as indicated by the hundreds of colleges offering scholarships to team members and the dozens of media networks that publicize the organization and its achievements.</p><p>Each year <i class=first>FIRST</i> develops the competition by supplying an objective to teams of students, who have six weeks to conceptualize, design, build, and test their robotic solution. Each year the objective is different; details are kept secret until early January, when they are simultaneously revealed to all teams during the Kick-Off.</p><p>Once the six weeks have passed, robots are transported to the competition site where teams will compete in March. Teams go head-to-head in a series of two-minute qualification and elimination rounds during a three-day competition. This format requires that teams strategize and build into their design both offensively and defensively. The robot that scores the most points during the two minutes wins each round, and the one that earns the most points in these rounds is declared champion.</p><h2 id=first-values><i class=first>FIRST</i> Values</h2><p><i class=first>FIRST</i> strives to teach not just engineering skills, but also life skills. <i class=first>FIRST</i> pushes for teams to exemplify gracious professionalism and coopertition.</p><p>Gracious professionalism is “the way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the values of others, and respects individuals and the community.” <i class=first>FIRST</i> teams can demonstrate this ideal by promoting good sportsmanship and maintaining the integrity of our members and team. While teams are happy to receive awards and do well in competitions, teams never put other down.</p><p>Coopertition, a theme that’s especially prevalent in competitions, is “to display unqualified kindness and respect for other teams, even in the face of fierce competition.” <i class=first>FIRST</i> teams cooperate with others even while competing, so teams can teach each other, promoting mutual learning.</p><p>To learn more about gracious professionalism and coopertition, refer to <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/"><i class=first>FIRST</i>’s website</a>.</p>
