<p>Founded in 1997, the Monta Vista Robotics FIRST Team #115 was established by a few friends looking for a way to venture into the the technological world through creative innovation.</p><p>Over the last twenty years, MVRT has taken great strides in technology and leadership by encouraging its members to further pursue their imaginations beyond the mundane world and into the extraordinary realm. However, none of the achievements and advancements in technology would have been gained without the continuous and unfailing support of our community, parents, and the more than valuable guidance of our advisors and alumni. They have assisted us in overcoming obstacles along the path for original and unique ideas.</p><p>MVRT continues to fulfill its mission in creating the “visionaries of tomorrow” today by participating in <i class=first>FIRST</i> and inspiring young students through mentoring and community outreach. We stand together as a diverse group of people ready to face hardships and difficulties and combine our ingenuity to attain a common goal: building a masterpiece and inspiring the next generation of engineers and leaders.</p><h2 id=mission-statement>Mission Statement</h2><p>Dedicated to fostering a passion in science and technology within our community, the Monta Vista Robotics Team inspires students and develops interpersonal skills through team-based engineering challenges.</p><h2 id=the-team-goals>The Team Goals</h2><ul><li>To create an environment that promotes sharing of knowledge, skills and experience.</li><li>To respect opinions of others as well as ourselves despite differences.</li><li>To create a friendly and professional environment.</li><li>To work towards an operating structure to ensure a solid team.</li><li>To promote the vision of <i class=first>FIRST</i> in the community.</li><li>To ensure equal opportunity for all.</li></ul><h2 id=local-teams>Local Teams</h2><ul><li><a href=https://www.fremontrobotics.com>Fremont Robotics</a></li><li><a href=http://lynbrookrobotics.com>Lynbrook Robotics</a></li><li><a href=http://homesteadrobotics.com>Homestead Robotics</a></li><li><p>Cupertino Robotics</p></li></ul><h2 id=current-members>Current Members</h2><ul><li><a href="/about/people/">Current Members</a></li></ul>
